Aluminum alloy Al6061 has wide range of application due to its properties. This alloy is a precipitate hardening alloy in which strengthening happens during aging process. In this process new phase start forming from supersaturated solid solution. Many efforts have been done for last few decades to find the effect of aging process on precipitating and to connect final properties of materials to volume fraction, size, and interface nature of precipitates.
