Our dataset consisted of X-ray scattering intensity images from 12 different samples of polyethylene. While each of the samples were being strain, the stress in the sample was measured and an X-scattering intensity image was taken roughly every four seconds. The twelve samples varied systematically between difference in densities, processing conditions, and thickness.
