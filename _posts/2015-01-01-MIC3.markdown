Machining is a subtractive manufacturing process that removes material via failure due to severe plastic deformation (SPD). The imposed processing conditions induce deformation conditions (strain, strain-rate, temperature) contribute to structural changes at small length scales. These structural changes can affect properties relevant to performance at the machined surface.
