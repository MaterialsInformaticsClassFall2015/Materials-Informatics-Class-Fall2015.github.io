The initial goals of this project were to develop processing - structure linkages for semicrystalline polyethylene molecular dynamics (PE-MD) simulations. After analysis of our sample data revealed major issues, the focus of the project was shifted to the comparison of traditional crystallinity analysis tools (such as density and Hermanâ€™s Orientation) versus a new approach developed over the course of the term.
